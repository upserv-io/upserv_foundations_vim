    DeleteThis - you can replace ChangeModel.ChangeAttachment with any image url
      or with the relative path of an image asset (only need path after app/assets/images/) 
    DeleteThis - variant, representation and preview can include transformation, ex:
      user.profile_image.variant(resize_to_limit: [200, 200])
      user.profile_image.representation(resize_to_limit: [100, 100])
      user.profile_image.preview(resize_to_limit: [500, 500]) 
    DeleteThis - variant can also use pre-defined transformations (this will not work for representation or preview) 
      user.profile_image.variant(:thumbnail)
    DeleteThis - common CSS:
      parent with set height and width, and image with
        object-contain
        object-cover
        other object-fit options (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/object-fit)
      classic "cover image"
        make parent width 100% and max-height of some value
        make image object-cover
      what else?
